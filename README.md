# Python Discord-Bot

This is a discord bot that shows random images of puppies and shows a motivational quote using Python.
## Appendix

Due to the pandemic and the rise in depression, I've seen the trend of self-care and doing things that cheer you up so I figured I'll make a bot that gives the user an aspiring and motivational quote while having the options to look at adorable dogs.




## Lessons Learned
I learned how adorable dogs are. I also find my mood getting better in a positive manner while looking at the images and gifs whenever a special command is used in discord.

I also learn how to scrape API better and also using less codes to do so as well. There were a few challenges that I've faced where I had trouble accessing JSON objects but after several trials and errors as well as googling, I'm glad to say that I've found my answers.
